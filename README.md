# Comparative Study of Clustering Algorithms

This repository contains a **comparative performance study of different clustering algorithms** using various **pre-processing techniques**, **different numbers of clusters**, and **multiple evaluation parameters**.

## 📌 Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (**Clustering.ipynb**) explores the effectiveness of various clustering algorithms by applying different data preprocessing techniques and evaluating their performance across multiple metrics.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
### 1️⃣ **Clustering Algorithms**
- K-Means
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

### 2️⃣ **Preprocessing Techniques**
- Standardization
- Normalization
- Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA)
- Feature Selection

### 3️⃣ **Evaluation Metrics**
- Silhouette Score
- Davies-Bouldin Index
- Inertia (for K-Means)
- Homogeneity & Completeness Score

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used for clustering is **Winequality**.
- Features have been preprocessed using different techniques before clustering.


## 📊 Results & Insights
- The notebook provides a comparative analysis of different clustering models and highlights the best-performing technique under different conditions.
- Visualizations (scatter plots, dendrograms, and heatmaps) are included for better interpretation.

## ✨ Customization
- You can **change the number of clusters** and **preprocessing techniques** in the notebook to experiment with different setups.
- Modify evaluation metrics as per your requirement.
